Dataset analysis completed as part of an assignment for STOR 455 - Methods of Data Analysis during the Spring 2020 semester at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. 
Students could work alone or in pairs, and Rina Deka and I chose to work together on this assignment. 
We were tasked with finding, cleaning (if necessary), and analyzing a dataset per the assignment instructions.
